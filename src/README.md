Lets create GroceryTracker, an application that lets the user track an item, they want to purchase froma grocery store. In this application we are only going to be dealing with a collection of items

- Add a 'org.example.GroceryList' class that will allow the user to add, remove and display items they want to get from the grocery store... these items will be placed on their "list" which will be displayed in the intellij console
- Use TDD to drive the creation of theis class
- Update the main method to give menu options to the user to implement these "list" tasks
